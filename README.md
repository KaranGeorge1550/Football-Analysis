# Football Analysis

This project is a Football analysis AI/ML system. It is being developed so I can learn about object detection and Machine Learning concepts.

## Tracking
The tracking is based of three distinct factors:
1. The closest bounding box
2. The predicted trajectory of the bounding box
3. The content inside of the bounding box

Goalkeeper is analysed as player.
